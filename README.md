## 👤 The Blueprint

I focus on **depth, discipline, and durability**. Understanding the underlying architecture matters more than memorizing frameworks.

**Core Beliefs:**
- 🧠 `skills > marks > titles`
- 🏗️ Build from fundamentals. Optimize for the long term.
- 🚫 No shortcuts. No random learning. Just consistent progress.
