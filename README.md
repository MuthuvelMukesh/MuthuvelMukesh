# 👨‍💻 Muthuvel Mukesh — Systems & Blockchain Builder (Student)

I’m an ongoing learner and builder focused on **systems, software fundamentals, and decentralized computing**.

My approach centers on *understanding deeply before building widely* — focusing on systems fundamentals, clean code, and meaningful projects that demonstrate skill growth.

## 🎨 Featured Repositories

Here are the repositories I’ve worked on so far:

### 🔹 **ECHO_AI**  
Static HTML project focused on UI fundamentals and responsive layout.  
🔗 *Showcases HTML/CSS skills; smaller but polished front-end output.*

### 🔹 **smart-hostel-mvp**  
Java-based hostel management system MVP.  
🔗 *Demonstrates basic backend logic and object-oriented programming.*

### 🔹 **project-based-learning (curated)** *(fork)*  
Curated list of structured tutorials and project resources.  
🔗 *Helps organize learning paths and real world building.*

## 💡 Learning Projects (Work In Progress)

These are not complete products yet, but reflect where I’m investing my focus:

- System design sketches (Linux internals + OS behavior)
- Solidity practice contracts (security, interfaces)
- Personal tools to automate development tasks

*(Soon to be showcased as full repos with detailed READMEs)*

## 📈 Consistency & Growth

I commit consistently, learn incrementally, and aim to complete projects that form a **strong engineering portfolio** over time.
